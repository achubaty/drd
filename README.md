# drd: Docker R-devel 

This repository will aim to provide daily Docker containers of R-devel.

It is related to the [rocker](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rocker)
repository which @cboettig and @eddelbuettel are now working on, and it
builds upon earlier Docker repos and automated builds in my repositories.
