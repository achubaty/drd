## drd: Docker R-devel 

This repository aims to provide daily builds of Docker containers based on
the then-current state of the R-devel SVN repository.

It is related to the [rocker](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rocker)
repository which @cboettig and @eddelbuettel are now working on, and it
builds upon earlier Docker repos and automated builds in my repositories.

#### Date

This build was triggered Sun Oct 19 16:55:09 CDT 2014.
